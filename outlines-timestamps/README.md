## Video Outlines/Timestamps

Coding Garden streams are fairly long so outlines/timestamps will help anyone that didn't tune in live to navigate the video.

An example of a very detailed outline with timestamps of the first official coding garden live stream can be found [here](aql62xliRzE.md)

## Contributing

* Copy the `TEMPLATE.md` file in this folder to a file with the format `video-id.md`
  * The video id can be found in the YouTube URL after the `?v=`
  * Example
    * For this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aql62xliRzE
    * The filename would be: `aql62xliRzE.md`
* Create an Outline
  * Most videos have an associated github repo with a TODO/Checklist of items associated with that video.
    * This outline is a good place to start, but is not always as detailed as it could be.
    * Feel free to add new items to the outline as you see fit
  * If an outline does not yet exist, one will need to be created.
* Update the outline with timestamps for each bullet point
  * Timestamps should use the format HH:MM:SS (e.g. 1:01:01) as youtube will allow users to click these timestamps to jump forward in the video.
* Add your name to the bottom of the file (e.g. Contributed by: @w3cj)
* After adding a new file, add a link to it in the list below
